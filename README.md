# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Md Anisur Rahman
## Full Stack Web Developer
I am a Full Stack Web developer. Besides, I am an Electrical & Automation Engineer. But I found my passion on web development and I decided to shift my path. I am a dedicated, hard-working and passionate person who can work under pressure . I love to accept challenges and do not give up until I become successful. I would like to see myself as a Senior developer within the next 2 years and I am working on it. I would like to expand my learned skill by working for a company.
